/**
 * GIG scan-status codes → our normalized status, from GIG's published scan list.
 *
 * The two transitions that matter gate real money/UX, so their sets are exact:
 *  • PRE_TRANSIT — the parcel is NOT yet in GIG's hands (created / awaiting or
 *    en-route-to collection). These must NOT flip the order to SHIPPED. Critically
 *    DLP = "delayed PICKUP" (still with the seller) and MENP = "enroute pickup"
 *    (rider on the way TO collect) belong here — the old default mapped them to
 *    IN_TRANSIT and would have marked an order shipped before GIG ever collected.
 *  • Possession (→ IN_TRANSIT → SHIPPED) — MPIK "picked up" is the authoritative
 *    pickup signal; SRFS "received from store to GIG hub/centre" is the authoritative
 *    DROP-OFF signal. Any hub/transit scan also implies GIG physically holds it.
 *  • DELIVERED gates the seller payout (walletService.releaseFundsOnDelivery) — kept
 *    to the four true delivery codes. "Arrived final destination" (MAFD/ARF/AHD) is
 *    NOT delivery; it stays IN_TRANSIT so we never pay out on an arrival scan.
 *  • RETURNED / FAILURE — hold funds, alert the seller.
 * Unrecognized codes default to IN_TRANSIT (see mapStatus): a safe assumption of
 * movement that can never, by construction, reach DELIVERED/RETURNED/FAILURE.
