/**
 * GIG rate model — placeholder.

 * The real Annexure-2 card (0.5–200kg × 4 zones × {Class, Basic}, with tier
 * breaks) will be seeded into the `CarrierRate` DB table and read from there.
 * Until then this is a faithful **linear approximation** of the early tiers:
 * base price @0.5kg + a per-half-kg increment, derived from the SLA's first two
 * rows of each zone/plan. Replace with the DB lookup — do not extend this by hand.
 *
 * CLASS  = our cost (negotiated).   BASIC = retail anchor (~17–21% higher).
 * All figures are NGN (VAT-inclusive per the SLA).
